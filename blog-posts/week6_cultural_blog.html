        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

        <p>Stereotype threat is defined as an experience of anxiety felt by a person who could confirm a negative stereotype regarding their race, gender, culture, or any social group. As a white heterosexual male, I&#39;m not going to pretend that I have had many hardships regarding stereotype threat or any sort of discrimination that people would consider hurtful or degrading. The only instance of stereotype threat, that I can think of, for me would be that all white heterosexual males are so incredibly privileged that we can not possibly understand any one&#39;s problems from any other social group.</p>

        <p>I understand that I might not know what it is like to live as another gender, race, or sexual orientation, but this also apparently means, to some people, that I am not allowed to have an opinion on any of these issues. This stifles any sort of conversation that I can have with others and labels me as a bigot. I realize this is a miniscule problem in the grand scheme of things, but this generally leads me to being silenced on any hotly contested issue. I would say I&#39;m very liberal with my social views, but I enjoy discussing topics with people and allow them to change my mind. My opinions are open to change, which allows me to not take it personally when someone uses logic and facts to change my point of view.</p>

        <p>Overall, my stereotype threat problem is miniscule and there isn&#39;t much I can do besides being as open as possible to other points of view.</p>
