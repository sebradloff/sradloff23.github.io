<h2>JavaScript and Web Development</h2>

<h3>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h3>

<p>JavaScript is on the rise as on the most popular programming languages in the world. What has led to this spike on popularity? I do not think there is any one reason, but there are several factors that certainly helped.</p>

<p>For starters, JavaScript is a great first programming language. It was developed as a client side scripting language, meaning all the work is done in the browser rather than an external server, and has been dubbed &quotfairly easy&quot to learn. While it might be a simple language, one can write plenty of advanced scripts while accounting for browser differences, things can become quite complex.</p>

<p>HTML5 can now support more complex JavaScript methods and functions. Real-time 3D graphics, geolocation and multitouch capabilities are only several JavaScript methods which HTML5 provides the structure.</p>

<p>Finally, JavaScript has the ability to meet rapid development demands while retaining a great user experience. This has it being pushed as the language used in mobile development platforms, coming from both Apple and Google.</p>

<h3>Pros of JavaScript:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. FAST!</dt>
	<dd>Being used in client-side operations is very fast, because it does not need to contact a server for an answer, it runs immediately. It is ready as soon as the browser is!</dd>
<dt>2. Easy to add on</dt>
	<dd>While building other parts of your code, you can run the rest of the code just fine. This is because of its simple load and go delivery. It only throws errors while executing a particular path of the program.</dd>
<dt>3. Everything is an object</dt>
	<dd>You can add properties to any object at any time, which allows you to access properties through the dot operator.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Cons of JavaScript</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Web browser compatibility</dt>
	<dd>Different web browsers will interpret JavaScript slightly differently, which can make it a pain to write the code for several different browsers.</dd>
<dt>2. Security issues</dt>
	<dd>Since the code executes on the client-side, there is the ability to embed malicious code in a web page to exploit the user&rsquo;s system. Modern browsers are constantly updating to plug any potential holes, but they still exist.</dd>
