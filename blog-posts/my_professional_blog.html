        <h2>Making My Blog &quot;Professional&quot;</h2>

        <p>This week I spent a considerable amount of time revamping my site. I kept the three column split, with a header navigation bar and footer. However, I made significant modifications to the color scheme, layout, and many other smaller improvements.</p>

        <p>My original color scheme was too bright and distracting. I went with a slightly darker scheme, but it still remains fun.</p>

        <p>The layout is still three columns, however, I changed the side bar content. I added a picture of myself along with a brief description, so readers know where the content is coming from at a first glance. The right side of the page currently includes both a simple tic tac toe and a Sudoku game, which will eventually be replaced by my own designed versions of those games. I had trouble figuring out what to put in that column, but I decided the games could be a nice touch to the sidebar instead of deadspace.</p>

        <p>The navigation bar now contains a link to my Github profile, labeled portfolio. Eventually I will create a portfolio html page with links to individual Github projects, including a brief overview for each project.</p>

        <p>Finally, I updated all of my previous blog posts to reflect these current changes. I hope to figure out a better way to do this in the future.</p>
