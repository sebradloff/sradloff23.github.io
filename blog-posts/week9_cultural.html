        <h2>How to Get Your Questions Answered</h2>

        <p>Looking at the Google+ community for my cohort, I&#39;ve noticed some patterns in terms of how questions are asked.</p>

        <p>The majority are specific technical questions, related to their current problem. The relevant code is generally included and if they are ambitious they will include a few details of what they have tried to remedy the situation. These are incredibly well written questions, but some of them go unanswered. There are several reasons this will happen for even the best written questions.</p>
        <p>The first reason being that you are unlucky and posted at the wrong time of day. Posting a question at 1 p.m. on a weekday might not get much of a response, since many people are working during phase 0 and would currently be at work. The other issue being, is that other questions could be asked as soon as others return home, burying your question in the feed.</p>

        <p>Next, your topic is not interesting to anyone. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not your fault either, but if people read your question and aren&#39;t interested in answering it, you&#39;re out of luck. Sadly, the best way to combat this would be if you&#39;re asking a similar question that someone else has thought of and comments on your question. People will then at least be drawn to your question and potentially help you answer it.</p>

        <p>Finally, your question takes too long to answer. Sometimes you may not realize that your question is not as specific as you thought it was, or it involves several steps to begin to analyze the problem. For instance, JavaScript questions asked on the G+ community are rarely answered, potentially due to the fact that Sublime Text 2 doesn&#39;t have a build for JavaScript. This requires one to go to js.do or a similar online JavaScript editor. This extra step can be a deterrent for many people. Fortunately, you can save your code on js.do and post that url to the G+ page. Taking out this simple step might have people answer your question.</p>

        <p>I hope this helps anyone reading this. These rules are good to follow on any forum. But above all of this, use your Google Fu to try and find the answer first. If you haven&#39;t tried to research the question on your own first, you&#39;re not really trying.</p>
