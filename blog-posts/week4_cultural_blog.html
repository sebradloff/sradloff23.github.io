<h2>Net Neutrality: You Need to Know</h2>

<p>Watch this video for a quick intro about net neurality:</p>

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/wtt2aSV8wdw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/wtt2aSV8wdw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<h3>What is Net Neutrality?</h3>

<p>Net neutrality is the idea that all Internet service providers and governments should treat all Internet data equally. This means that there can be no discrimination or charging differently based on content, user, or site platform. This idea is also a part of the open internet.</p>

<h3>The Debate in the USA:</h3>

<p>The FCC has been the ruling body in the USA, shaping the current laws of open internet. The first policy enacted in the USA in favor open internet, was written in 2005 with the following four principles in mind for internet users:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Access the lawful Internet content of their choice</li>
	<li>Run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement</li>
	<li>Connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network</li>
	<li>Competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers</li>
</ol>

<p>You can continue to read about the development of the open internet policy shifts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">here</a>, however, what&#39;s important is that over the years Internet service providers have begun to bandwith throttle or &quotslow-down&quot user access to certain high data usage websites.</p>

<p>There was Comcast throttling BitTorrent speed back in 2008, proven in a court of law, while they admitted no wrongdoing. In late 2013 through early 2014, Verizon and Comcast bandwith throttled Netflix access to their customers. This was during a period where Comcast was demanding money from Netflix to handle all the data the website provides to it&#39;s users. Comcast throttled Netflix&#39;s service by passing all their data through a third party, before it reached the end users. This effectively slowed download speeds by 50%, which is clearly the act of paying a ransom and setting the hostages free. Guess what? Verizon wants in on the Netflix money too and is using a similar tactic as Comcast to achieved their goal.</p>

<h3>This is Really Scary! Proposed 2014 FCC Policy:</h3>

<p>The FCC announced in February of this year, to create new laws to enforce net neutrality while complying with previous court rulings. In late April, the new proposed rules would allow Internet Service Providers to build special &quotinternet traffic lanes&quot with faster download speeds for companies willing to pay more money. You might first think: &quotHey, that&#39;s not too bad! There should totally be even faster internet!&quot That&#39;s where you are wrong!</p>

<p>In the language of the proposal, there is no standard definition for a faster lane. Business want to make money with spending the least amount of money possible. The easiest way to create a &quotfaster lane&quot is to throttle every single companies&#39; or persons&#39; website who doesn&#39;t pay the premium price. Screw that! An analogy would be if a company told you they could make you louder than everyone else in a room full of 10 people. Instead of giving you a megaphone, they put duct tape over the mouths of everyone else. You might be &quotlouder&quot by comparison, but they effectively did nothing to innovate or create an environment in which you were actually &quotlouder&quot than you personally were before.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The internet is the only place in the entire world where the playing field is equal. Everyone is equally as &quotloud&quot as everyone else, but the end users decide what is deemed important, noteworthy, and interesting, not the dollar amount you pay for your download speed.</p>
