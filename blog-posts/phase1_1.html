        <h1>DBC Phase 1: Mock Assessment Day</h1>

        <h2>Cohort: Bobolinks, Chicago, July 2014</h2>


        <p>I haven&#39;t taken the time to blog since I started DBC, partly because I&#39;m spending most of my time here learning as much as I possibly can. Today was our Phase 1 mock assessment, in which our OO programming skills were tested. I&#39;m not going to give it away for the sake of future cohorts, but it involves basic modeling of objects, parsers, command line arguments, and presenting the data to the user.</p>

        <p>The challenge itself wasn&#39;t all that difficult for me and was pretty reflective of my time here so far at DBC. Whether it was my intense preparation in Phase 0 or my past experience with VBA and Java, I don&#39;t know, but I have found the challenges each day to be relatively easy. That&#39;s not to say that I could code them without references, but I always have a general idea of how the challenge could be accomplished. Nothing has truly stumped me as of yet, but I expect something will in Phase 2.</p>

        <p>The hardest part of DBC so far, hands down, is paired programming. Pairing with someone all day to complete challenges and write code is an interesting experience. In Phase 0 we pair programmed over Google hangout, but this was only a taste of what was to come. Both of you could control your own computer, quickly look something up, test something out in irb, all while your partner did what they wanted. You were essentially independent.</p>

        <p>Here at DBC, Monday through Wednesday are pairing days, meaning you will complete your challenges for the day with another person. You are assigned to random groups of four or five in which you switch pairs all three days. Since you&#39;re both working from the same machine, you really have to consider your actions and how they affect your partner. Having had eight pairing days since starting Phase 1 (including some weekend pairing), I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about what can make a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; pairing session.</p>

        <p>The &quot;good&quot; pairing sessions, generally stem from my partner and I having a common understanding of the base material needed to complete the challenges for the day. This involves a combination of adequately preparing during Phase 0 and actually absorbing the new material while at DBC. So, I love testing out smaller ideas in irb or directly in my code and just seeing what happens. Trial and error are great for smaller portions of my code, while pseudocoding and writing RSPEC are incredibly useful for planning and making sure my code is actually doing what I want it to do! A good partner understands my need to open up a terminal window and quickly check out my idea. At the same time, for me to be a good partner, I need to allow my pair to do the same and explain my reasoning behind the code I suggest/write. </p>

        <p>The &quot;bad&quot; pairing session, seem to stem from a severe gap in knowledge between partners. Many people believe this is an excellent opportunity for you to reinforce your knowledge. While I agree, not in this context for daily challenges at DBC. We have roughly six hours to finish the challenges before the instructors leave for the day. Ideally, you should have 85-100% of the challenges done by then, therefore requiring little help outside of regular hours. However, in a &quot;bad&quot; pair, you could potentially spend hours stuck on a challenge because your partner does not understand a concept we are expected to know. This can quickly become frustrating and feels like a race against the clock, rather than a truly engaging learning session. Fortunately, DBC instructors reinforced the idea of time-boxing challenges and making sure to seek instructors for help if you&#39;re struggling with a concept for some one on one teaching.</p>

        <p>Overall, my experience with pairing has been positive and a lot of fun. Over the first weekend, three of us Bobolinks decided to model a binary tree. It was an incredible experience, in which we spent the majority of the weekend going back and forth between the whiteboard and coding. By Sunday evening we had a working model which could print out all three traversal patterns, add nodes, delete nodes, and properly balance the tree. At some point, I plan on going back to that project to refactor and add more methods.</p>

        <p>As I said earlier, today was our mock assessment and I decided it would be a good time to reflect on my time thus far at DBC and my future here. Two fellow Bobolinks approached me with the idea of hosting a cohort mentoring/pairing session this weekend, wherein all cohort members could help each other on potentially difficult concepts. The idea is to pair strong members with weak members and those in the middle with each other. Since I finished the daily challenges relatively early today, I decided to create a challenge for the cohort to work on this weekend. It&#39;s a simple modeling of a movie theater using skills learned throughout the first two weeks here at DBC. I think it will be good practice for everyone considering you could build out the project quite extensively.
