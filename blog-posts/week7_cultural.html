<h1>Cultural Blog, Week 7</h1>

<h2>What do I value?</h2>

<p>When I think of the times in my life where I&#39;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind: accomplishment, ambition, competition, excellence, personal development, physical challenge, and recognition.</p>

<p>I find myself valuing the accomplishment of difficult mental or physical tasks. That feeling once you finish an incredibly arduous task, whether it&#39;s a personal record on my squat or solving a difficult Ruby coding exercise, results in both a giant sense relief and an almost perpetual state of awesomeness. This feeling allows me to &quot;win the day&quot;, meaning no matter how bad of a day I had before this moment, everything is now alright and will be alright. &quot;Winning the day&quot; clears my mind of negative thoughts and feelings, allowing me to focus on the good and the great.</p>

<p>From the values I listed earlier, I can personally say that I do not necessarily live up to the values. These values are instead so deeply ingrained into who I am that I simply live them. I have a need to consistently improve both my mental and physical strength, that all my values are byproducts.</p>

<p>The last piece of advice I gave was to a friend who was choosing between graduate school or a job. I try to avoid giving people advice, unless I have specifically been in their situation, instead I act as a good listener and make both pro and con arguments that they may or may not have thought of before.</p>

<p>How do I feel when I think about my values? I guess I think that somewhere in there explains why I&#39;m such a motivated and dedicated person when it comes to any engaging task put in front of me.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m ever feeling down at DBC, I think I&#39;ll take a second to remember how far I&#39;ve come, how much I&#39;ve learned, how much I&#39;ve grown, to be in this moment learning from a supportive community. Then I&#39;ll realize how much longer the road ahead of me is, but how manageable each stretch on the long road can become with the right mindset. That&#39;s what I&#39;ll think about.</p>
