<h2>How's it going so far?</h2>

<p>Haven taken the Gregoric Thinking Style test before beginning DBC, I tested as a concrete random. Throughout this first unit of phase 0, I&#39;ve noticed that I definitely fit this style of learning. The biggest struggle for me has been this formal reporting, where I have to detail each of my answers. It makes quite a bit of sense. I&#39;ve struggled with writing  reflections, because they require me to fully examine my thought process. I&#39;m going to take the time to really reflect throughout the process from now on, so I can take in as much as possible. Keeping a piece of paper next to me, so I can make notes throughout the process, analyzing my frustrations, might be helpful once it comes time to reflect.</p>

<p>I have always been a guy who believed in growing my intelligence. I can admit when I donâ€™t know something, and therefore have no shame in my current unknowing. It is not an ignorance, simply the acknowledgement that I have never thought of this concept before or learned much about it. This idea regarding intelligence, also allows me to respect others who are trying to learn about the world. I will never put someone down for not knowing, only for not trying to learn. That in my opinion, is true ignorance. Choosing to not learn.</p>
