        <h2>DBC Paired Programming</h2>

        <p>Paired programming at DBC is interesting to say the least. You&#39;re putting two people together in a Google hangout and expect them to work together to complete a coding challenge. The session is structured such that there is one &quotdriver&quot and one &quotnavigator&quot at a time. This essentially means one person is writing the code in a stypi, the driver, and the other is guiding the driver through each method construction while keeping an eye on the &quotbig picture&quot, the navigator.</p>

        <p>Solving challenges like this can be a bit of challenge in of itself. From my experience, people love to talk and express themselves but do not feel the same way about listening and absorbing what another person has to say. Since DBC has very driven people, you can encounter clashes in which both of you want to speak your mind and direct the thinking process. This is why you should start out every session with five minutes of small talk, in which you discuss how you prefer to approach the challenges, i.e. pseudocoding or talking it out, and how you are currently feeling. It is in your best interest to tell your pairing partner how you&#39;re feeling so you can both empathize with potential frustrations down the road.</p>

        <p>The best part of pair programming for me thus far, has been explaining concepts which I know to truly cement my knowledge of the material. It&#39;s a great confidence booster and I had the opportunity to help someone in my cohort- win-win!</p>

        <p>The most frustrating part of pair programming is when you have to rely on voice communication only, thereby not allowing you to see facial expressions. I felt like I was constantly cutting my partner off while they were speaking, because it was difficult to tell if that was truly the end of their thought.</p>

        <p>Once you finish a pairing session, you write feedback for the other person which should be actionable, specific, and kind. It&#39;s difficult to write at first, but with each pairing session you realize what is actionable and specific, being kind comes naturally to most.</p>

        <p>Reading your own feedback has yet to truly benefit me. I think part of the problem is that everyone is still trying to figure out what others can improve on with these relatively simple exercises. This should not be a factor in a few weeks when the level of difficulty significantly increases. While I feel great that most of the feedback I&#39;ve received is positive and kind, it isn&#39;t really specific. Learn more Ruby isn&#39;t specificâ€¦</p>

        <p>From reading my feedback I feel I could benefit immensely from reading POODR. I&#39;ll probably read this for the next week while I&#39;m in the hospital recovering from my ACL surgery in here in Germany. I&#39;ve read the first two chapters thus far, both are quite enjoyable to read.</p>

        <p>Writing feedback is relatively easy when you take notes during your pairing session. I keep a text doc open to make notes on specific things partner did well or failed to recognize, so I can write better feedback. The most difficult part of writing feedback is when you have nothing to recommend for the other person to improve, besides the terribly non-descript &quotlearn more Ruby.&quot</p>

        <p>Overall, paired programming is something I enjoy. I get to meet the people who are in my cohort and sharpen my skills.</p>
