<h3>My Take on the DBC Experience</h3>
<p>I began doing extensive research on all development bootcamps I could find before I decided that DBC would be right for me. There were so many to choose from with long waits or were simply cashing in on this web dev boom. Through my research, I realized the DBC experience is more of a personal reflection while learning some incredibly useful skills. Everyone is highly motivated to succeed, but I appreciate the honesty where Shereef states, if you finish the course you will be a "world class beginner." That frankness was nice to hear, but thankfully, quickly followed up with comments that make you understand why you would be "world class." The skills that you are taught at DBC give you a solid foundation in emotional intelligence and critical thinking, allowing you to enter the workfoce as a somewhat productive employee. I see myself taking full advantage of this rapid learning and am really excited about it.</p>

<h3>My Expectations of DBC</h3>

<p>My expectations have not changed much since starting the program. A few doubts creep into my thoughts now and then, such as "is this really worth the time and money?" I guess I'm incredibly guilty the restaurant consumer mentality, but I promise to work on that for this course. I realize it's relatively experimental and that's pretty cool and exciting. My skills in CSS and HTML are increasing through the use of these "problem sets" or "assignments" so to speak; something I would never have done on my own. Overall, I expect to become that "world class beginner" and hope to find a great fit in a company out in California. That's the second step of the dream; I'm willing to do what it takes to get there.</p>

<h3>Am I Nervous?</h3>

<p>Hell yea I'm nervous. But I'm that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imH1B_4Ge6w#t=0m3s" target="_blank">excited scared feeling</a>. I think it's only natural to a certain extent, when diving head first into the unknown. I know I already like programming, it's more of a nervousness along the lines of "will I be employable." I'm not expecting anything ridiculous and understand I would be enlisting in an apprenticeship, but does that opportunity actually exist? I guess I'll find out in 18 weeks, after tons of long hours and hard work.</p>
