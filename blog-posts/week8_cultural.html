        <h1>Cultural Blog, Week 8</h1>

        <h2>Brevity and Openness in the Workplace</h2>


        <p>The workplace is an environment in which emotional conflicts can come into play more than normal friendships. With friends, you treat each other as equal for the most part, you can joke around, and know that you will be friends the next day. At work, there are huge power imbalances which can make for tense emotional conflicts.</p>

        <p>At my last job, my boss and I meshed relatively well, personality wise and in terms of productivity. Unfortunately, when communicating through email or the office IM, it&#39;s difficult to detect tone, especially in short messages. Sometimes I would get an email or IM like this: &quot;Did you email that report this morning?&quot; Nothing else&#8230;</p>

        <p>In my mind, I&#39;m scrambling to remember what report my boss was even talking about. We hadn&#39;t discussed sending out any report this morning. While I&#39;m flustered and squirming in my chair thinking that I had missed sending out the report, she thought it was just a quick innocent question with no malice behind it. I was worried over nothing.</p>

        <p>Later that week, we sat down to discuss my performance and to plan my work for the upcoming weeks. I asked her if the brevity in her emails and IMs was to get straight to the point rather than question my abilities. Thankfully we talked it out and realized that all IMs and emails should be treated as simple innocent questions, devoid of malice or questioning of my abilities. We agreed that if she did have a problem with my work, that we would meet in a conference room to discuss the issues. This ended up being the best solution, because it allowed us to be brief with one another to maintain productivity, but not suffer emotionally from the exchanges.</p>

        <p>From this experience, I learned it&#39;s best to voice your feelings with your boss or coworkers rather than let it fester and potentially damage your productivity. When I was tasked with training three other people to take over my account, I started out every meeting by stating the same thing. &quot;Everything I say today isn&#39;t a personal attack on you, I&#39;m simply critiquing your work so you can learn how to improve. I will point out great work, but if I don&#39;t say anything about a section, assume that you did a great job.&quot; I tried to end every session with the actual positives of the overall report, rather than creating the classic &quot;SHIT sandwich.&quot; My relationship with all three of those coworkers remained healthy. I think it helps to keep a &quot;two way street&quot;, as to allow them to freely ask questions or call me out when they think I am wrong. That&#39;s probably best advice I can give about office relationships.</p>
