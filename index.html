<h2>SQL Injections and Sanitizing Your Data</h2>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png">

<p>I&#39;ve seen this XKCD around the internet for quite some time and never truly understood the joke until this week. During week 7 of phase 0, we learned about the basics of SQL and if you were truly ambitious (read me), one could complete the bonus challenge combining Ruby and SQL.</p>

<p>The bonus challenge involved creating Ruby methods which would take certain arguments, fetching the information from a database table using SQL, and returning a properly formatted result. One of the assignments was to make sure the SQL inputs were properly sanitized before making the SQL call. Here is an example:</p>

<figure>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" style="font-size: 10px;">
require 'sqlite3'

$db = SQLite3::Database.open "congress_poll_results.db"

def print_representative_state(*state)
	states = *state
	states.each {|state| (state.match(/^[[:alpha:]]+$/) && (state.length == 2)) ? next : raise(ArgumentError.new("#{state} is not a proper state abreviation"))}

	puts "REPRESENTATIVES AND THE STATE THEY REPRESENT"
	
	states.each {|state| 
 	my_info = $db.execute("SELECT name, location FROM congress_members WHERE location='#{state}'")
 	my_info.each {|name, state| puts "#{name} - #{state}"}}
end

print_representative_state("NJ", "NY", "ME", "FL", "AK")

</pre>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, the method takes a splat argument, allowing for theoretically unlimited state names to be inputted during the method call. The splat argument is assigned to an array named states. The first iteration of states.each checks if each state inputted has an argument containing only characters of the alphabet and a length of two characters. If either of those tests fail, it raises an ArgumentError and will not perform the SQL query. This might not be the best method to sanitize the input data, but for the purposes of this exercise, it does a pretty good job of preventing potentially malicious SQL queries. Let me explain the why.</p>

<p>Looking back at the intro XKCD comic, the mother named her child &quot;Robert&#39;); DROP TABLE Students;--&quot; (sans outer double quotes). What most likely happened, is the school inputted her sons name into the school&#39;s system which queries their SQL database to add a students to the table named Students. The name Robert followed by single quote, closes the string most likely meant for the student name in the SQL query. The semi-colon that follows closes the current command, which is why the command that follows &quot;DROP TABLE STUDENTS;&quot; is will be run unless SQL realizes something is going wrong. This is why the double dash follows the DROP command, to &quot;eat&quot; any of the SQL code which would normally follow the student&#39;s name. Robert&#39;); DROP TABLE Students;-- effectively deleted the database table named Students. You can see why not sanitizing your inputs can be a HUGE issue.</p>

<p>As a new programmer, the best you can do to protect yourself against basic SQL injections, is to make sure user inputs are sanitized or checked before used in SQL queries. A simple three to four lines of code can save you time, money, and frustration.</p>

	<h2>Introduction to Sebastian Radloff</h2>

	<p>Hey there! If you're reading this, you've come across my DevBootcamp (DBC) blog. Throughout the course I will be updating this blog with specific topics and random musings. You can expect completely unfiltered opinions and tons of spelling and grammatical errors (no spellcheck in Sublime Text 2).</p>

	<p>A little about myself. I realized after hours of toiling with learning code on my own, countless cups of coffee, and a playthrough Kanye West's entire disography later, that programming/coding/development is something I wanted to do. There's nothing quite like the feeling of getting your code to run fluidly. Essentially, if it's 2 am and a project is due at 8 am, this is what I'd rather be doing, with a giant smile on my face.</p>

	<p>In general, I love sports, all types of music, working out, a stiff drink, and being informed. You'll get to know me throughout my future posts.</p>
