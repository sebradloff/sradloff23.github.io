<h2>How's it going so far?</h2>

<p>Haven taken the Gregoric Thinking Style test before beginning DBC, I tested as a concrete random. Throughout this first unit of phase 0, I’ve noticed that I definitely fit this style of learning. The biggest struggle for me has been this formal reporting, where I have to detail each of my answers. It makes quite a bit of sense. I’ve struggled with writing  reflections, because they require me to fully examine my thought process. I’m going to take the time to really reflect throughout the process from now on, so I can take in as much as possible. Keeping a piece of paper next to me, so I can make notes throughout the process, analyzing my frustrations, might be helpful once it comes time to reflect.</p>

<p>I have always been a guy who believed in growing my intelligence. I can admit when I don’t know something, and therefore have no shame in my current unknowing. It is not an ignorance, simply the acknowledgement that I have never thought of this concept before or learned much about it. This idea regarding intelligence, also allows me to respect others who are trying to learn about the world. I will never put someone down for not knowing, only for not trying to learn. That in my opinion, is true ignorance. Choosing to not learn.</p>
