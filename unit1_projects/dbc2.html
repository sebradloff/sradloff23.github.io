	<h2><span style="color:rgb(0,19,62)">1. Jadaveon Clowney</span></h2>
	<p>Jadaveon Clowney, hands down, was the overall best athlete coming out of this draft class. His combine numbers were impressive; he was a top performer in the 40 (4.53 s), a 37.5 inch vertical, and a 124 inch broad jump. Clowney's arms are 34.5 inches long, giving him a great range to disrupt the quarterback's vision or knock down some balls. He posses an overall desire to win, even though the media likes to blow his down-to-down "effort" out of proportion. I think with the proper guidance, he'll adjust to the mentality of the pro game just fine. Overall, great pickup by the Texans. People will argue whether they needed to draft a QB, but Clowney is just too good to pass up. J.J. Watt and Jadaveon Clowney on each side of the line will wreak havoc for offensive lines and quarterbacks alike. I see the running game being relatively non-existant, with the need for a running back to chip either DE on every single play. Plus, Rex Grossman made it to the Super Bowl with an incredible Bears defense and special teams, it could happen for the Texans.</p>

	<h2><span style="color:rgb(187,162,98)">2. Greg Robinson</span></h2>
	<p>The Rams acquired this pick from the Redskins back in 2012. Greg Robinson stands 6'5", weighs 332 pounds, and runs the 40 in 4.92 seconds. Holy Shit! On top of that pure athleticism, he is considered the best run blocker in the draft, using loads of aggression to fuel his leg drive. Unfortunately, with any delayed blocking scheme, he has trouble keeping his feet under him; he gets beaten by speed and agility. The good news, is that he remains open about his weaknesses and said he will do whatever it takes. Overall, Robinson is a relatively versatile player, with the ability to play right tackle or more of a guard. The Rams needed this versatility granted last season's O-Line only played 295 of 968 snaps together. Hopefully this gives Zach Stacy more running room and the ability to make fantastic plays.</p>
