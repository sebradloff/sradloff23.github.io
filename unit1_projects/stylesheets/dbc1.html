		<h1>First week in DBC phase 0</h1>
		<p>It's been an interesting process so far. I'm learing a lot! Most of the information is presented to you through multiple links found around the internet placed in one GitHub project. It's crazy just how much there is to learn, but I'm really excited at the prospect. I think I'll have a better idea of how Phase 0 progresses, once I get to weeks 3 or 4.</p>
		
		<h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
		
		<p>I have been tinkering around with Java, VBA, and C for the past year. I started taking Harvard X's CS50 and realized that I love this type of problem solving.</p>
		
		<p>Added bonus, I love to work while listening to music, and this is definetly one of the few carreer paths in which that is possible. The <i>potential</i> lifestyle is enticing. Work 50 hours a week, continuously learning new tools and working on great problems. <b>Who wouldn't want to do this?</b></p>
